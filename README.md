BJCP-Static
===========

BJCP-Static is a JSON API for BJCP style guide data.  The BJCP style guide is not updated often (the current version was released in 2008), it's a small dataset, and it's likely to be duplicated in all or most beer-related applications, so it lends itself well to being distributed as static files.
